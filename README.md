### CLI Companion
Install the cross-platform CLI with `npm i -g soundbored` for quick automation. Source: [christomitov/soundbored-cli](https://github.com/christomitov/soundbored-cli).

## Quickstart

1. Copy the sample environment and set the minimum values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Required for local testing
   # DISCORD_TOKEN=...
   # DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=...
   # DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   # PHX_HOST=localhost
   # SCHEME=http
   ```
2. Run the published container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 4000:4000 --env-file ./.env christom/soundbored
   ```
3. Visit http://localhost:4000, invite the bot, and trigger your first sound.

> Create the bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), enable **Presence**, **Server Members**, and **Message Content** intents, and grant Send Messages, Read History, View Channels, Connect, and Speak permissions when you invite it.

### Discord App Setup

1. In the Discord Developer Portal, open your application and go to **Bot** → enable **Presence**, **Server Members**, and **Message Content** intents.
2. Still in the portal, go to **OAuth2 → Redirects** and add every URL that will serve Soundbored to the **Redirects** list. For example:
   - `http://localhost:4000/auth/discord/callback` (local development)
   - `https://your.domain.com/auth/discord/callback` (production, replace with your domain)
   Discord requires the redirect in your app configuration to match exactly what the browser uses during login; otherwise, OAuth will fail.
3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the same page—add them to your `.env` file as `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`.
4. Use **OAuth2 → URL Generator** (scope `bot`) to produce the invite link with the permissions listed above.

## Local Development

```bash
mix setup        # Fetch deps, prepare DB, build assets
mix phx.server   # or iex -S mix phx.server
```

Useful commands:
- `mix test` – run the test suite (coverage via `mix coveralls`).
- `mix credo --strict` – linting.

`docker compose up` also works for a containerized local run; it respects the same `.env` configuration.

## Environment Variables

All available keys live in `.env.example`. Configure the ones that match your setup:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | ✔ | Bot token used to play audio in voice channels. |
| `EDA_DAVE` | optional | Override for Discord E2EE voice negotiation in EDA. Default is enabled; set `false` only for troubleshooting. |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` / `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | ✔ | OAuth credentials for Discord login. |
| `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` / `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` | optional | Protect the browser UI with HTTP basic auth. API routes stay behind API token auth. |
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE` | ✔ | Signing/encryption secret; generate via `mix phx.gen.secret` or `openssl rand -base64 48`. Takes precedence over `SECRET_KEY_BASE_FILE`.|
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE_FILE` | optional | Path to file containing signing/encryption secret (e.g. for docker secrets). Preferred for security. |
| `PHX_HOST` | ✔ | Hostname the app advertises (`localhost` for local runs). |
| `SCHEME` | ✔ | `http` locally, `https` in production. |
| `AUTO_JOIN` | optional | Voice join mode. `play` (default) — bot joins when you play a sound. `presence` — bot follows users into channels. `false` — manual `!join` only. |
| `VOICE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | optional | Seconds of inactivity before the bot auto-leaves. Defaults to `600` (10 min). Set to `0` to disable. In `play` mode: timer resets per sound, bot also leaves when the last user departs. In `false` mode: timer starts after the last user leaves. In `presence` mode: ignored. |
| `BIND_IP` | optional | IP address the HTTP server binds to. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`; set to `0.0.0.0` to bind all interfaces (e.g. Docker dev). |

## Deployment

The application is published to Docker Hub as `christom/soundbored`.

### Simple Docker Host
```bash
docker pull christom/soundbored:latest
docker run -d -p 4000:4000 --env-file ./.env christom/soundbored
```
If you place the container behind your own reverse proxy, set `PHX_HOST` and `SCHEME` in `.env` to match the external URL and terminate TLS in your proxy. No additional compose files are required.

## Usage

After inviting the bot to your server, join a voice channel and type `!join` to have the bot join the voice channel. Type `!leave` to have the bot leave. You can upload sounds to Soundbored and trigger them there and they will play in the voice channel.

The bot manages voice channels automatically in two ways:

The `AUTO_JOIN` variable controls three modes:

- **`play` (default)**: the bot joins automatically when you play a sound from the web UI or API. It leaves when the last user departs or after `VOICE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` seconds of no playback activity (default: 600 s / 10 min).
- **`presence`**: the bot proactively follows users into voice channels on join events, and leaves immediately when the last user departs. The idle timeout is ignored in this mode.
- **`false`**: fully manual — use `!join` / `!leave`. If `VOICE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is set, the bot leaves automatically that many seconds after the last user departs.

## API

The API is used to trigger sounds from other applications. Create a personal API token in **Settings** after signing in, then send it as `Authorization: Bearer <USER_API_TOKEN>`.

Current API workflow supports:
- listing sounds
- uploading local files
- creating URL-backed sounds
- queueing playback for a specific sound
- stopping active playback

### Endpoints

#### List sounds
```bash
curl https://soundboardurl.com/api/sounds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <USER_API_TOKEN>"
```
Returns `200 OK` with `%{data: [...]}`.

#### Upload a local file
```bash
curl -X POST https://soundboardurl.com/api/sounds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <USER_API_TOKEN>" \
  -F "source_type=local" \
  -F "name=wow" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/wow.mp3" \
  -F "tags[]=meme" \
  -F "volume=90"
```
Returns `201 Created` with `%{data: sound}`.

#### Create a URL-backed sound
```bash
curl -X POST https://soundboardurl.com/api/sounds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <USER_API_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source_type":"url","name":"wow","url":"https://example.com/wow.mp3","tags":["meme","reaction"],"volume":90}'
```
Returns `201 Created` with `%{data: sound}`.

#### Queue playback for a sound
```bash
curl -X POST https://soundboardurl.com/api/sounds/123/play \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <USER_API_TOKEN>"
```
Returns `202 Accepted` with `%{data: %{status: "accepted", ...}}` because playback is queued asynchronously.

#### Stop active playback
```bash
curl -X POST https://soundboardurl.com/api/sounds/stop \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <USER_API_TOKEN>"
```
Returns `202 Accepted` with `%{data: %{status: "accepted", ...}}` because the stop request is also asynchronous.

Errors use `%{error: message}` or `%{errors: changeset_errors}` depending on whether the failure is request-level or validation-level.

## Changelog

### v1.7.0 (2026-03-07)

#### ✨ New Features
- Switched the Discord voice/runtime integration over to EDA, bringing DAVE support for current Discord voice encryption negotiation.
- Expanded the authenticated API so external tools can list sounds, upload local files, create URL-backed sounds, queue playback, and stop playback with personal user tokens.
- Public URL handling is now centralized so Discord invite/auth links and API examples stay aligned with the configured host and scheme.

#### ⚙️ Improvements
- Audio playback startup is faster and more resilient, reducing common delay/glitch cases during sound playback.
- Voice runtime handling was split into smaller policy/command/presence modules, making Discord connection behavior easier to reason about and maintain.
- Upload and tag persistence flows were consolidated so the LiveView and API paths share the same domain logic.
- The app now boots in a degraded mode when optional voice runtime capabilities are unavailable instead of failing startup entirely.

#### 🧪 Tests & Quality
- Added coverage for command handling, runtime capability detection, public URL behavior, API auth, upload flows, and collaborative sound management rules.
- Clarified the intended collaboration model: any signed-in user can edit shared sound details, but only the original uploader can delete a sound.
- Removed stale dependencies and cleanup scaffolding while continuing the broader code-health refactor.

### v1.6.0 (2025-10-01)

#### ✨ New Features
- New consolidated `Settings` view replaces the standalone API tokens screen and keeps token creation, revocation, and inline API examples in one place.
- Stats dashboard adds a week picker, richer recent activity stream, and refreshed layout under the new name “Stats”.
- “Play Random” now respects whatever filters are active, pulling from the current search results or selected tags only.

#### ⚙️ Improvements
- Shared tag components and modal tweaks streamline sound management and reduce layout shifts.
- Navigation highlights the active page and keeps Settings aligned with the rest of the app.
- Mobile refinements across the main board and settings eliminate horizontal scrolling and polish button spacing.
- Basic Auth now quietly skips enforcement when credentials are not configured instead of blocking the UI.

#### 🧪 Tests & Quality
- Expanded LiveView coverage for the new Settings page, Stats interactions, and filtered random playback.
- Updated CI workflow and Dependabot configuration keep coverage and dependency checks automated.

#### 📦 Dependencies
- Bumped Phoenix stack and related dependencies, plus cleaned up mix configuration and docs to match the new release.

### v1.5.0 (2025-09-14)

#### ✨ New Features
- User-scoped API tokens with DB storage (generate/revoke in Settings > API Tokens).
- API requests authenticated via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` are attributed to the token’s user and increment stats accordingly.
- In-app API help with copy-to-clipboard curl commands that auto-fill your site URL and token.
- Added Settings link in the navbar for quick access.
- Released a new CLI for easier local and CI integrations.

#### ⚙️ Improvements
- Search bar: reduced debounce to 200ms and added inline spinner while searching.
- Recent Plays: fixed item “disappearing” by using stable DB ids and deterministic ordering; clicked items now bump to the top correctly.

#### 🧪 Tests & Quality
- Added tests for API token lifecycle, API auth with DB tokens, Basic Auth, and the Settings LiveView.
- Coverage improved to ~96% (via mix coveralls).

#### 🔁 Compatibility
- DB-backed personal API tokens are the supported authentication path for API access.
